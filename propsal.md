## Description
My mom, Kim OBryan asked for help with her WordPress site - I decided to avoid the issues with WP by rebuilding the site from scratch. I've made the public views and today I started on the authentication. My goal is to finish the authentication and associated views. The full site should have models for "readers" the students of my Rockin' Readers. I want to enable a user who signs up to have 1+ associated readers (like a user would be a parent who has at least one child reading on Rockin' Readers). This is my main goal for this project, but if I end up with extra time, I'd like to add PayPal integration and start making admin views for her to run the business more smoothly.

## Challenges I Anticipate
I'm new to node/express (withdrew from that class) although not js. Integrating different technologies will be a challenge (today I learned how to use environment variables on a heroku app, for instance). Because mLabs will soon be unavailable on Heroku, I want to move the site to GoDaddy asap (where the WP site is currently). I'm still learning about Passport.js but there are a lot of tutorials for it. I'm concerned about security because this site is intended to be used as more than just a demo piece.

## Skateboard

Finish user auth features. Login works, but I need register and logout still.

## Bike

Add CRUD ability for readers.

## Car

Add PayPal integration.

## Beyond

- Gamify reader assessments.
- Admin view of students
- User friendly scheduling tool.

## Personal Achievement Goals:

1. Gain node/express experience
1. Gain passport.js experience
2. Get site into state to move to GoDaddy
